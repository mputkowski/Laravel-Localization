Localization for Laravel

## Installation
||L6|L7|L8|L9|L10|L11|L12
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|v4|&check;|&check;|&check;|&check;|&cross;|&cross;|&cross;|
|v5|&cross;|&cross;|&cross;|&check;|&check;|&check;|&check;|

Add package to composer.json
```
composer require mputkowski/laravel-localization
```

Publish package's config file
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="mputkowski\Localization\ServiceProvider"
```

### Laravel 11 or newer

Append the middleware to the `web` group in the `bootstrap/app.php`:
```php
->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
    $middleware->web(append: [
        \mputkowski\Localization\Middleware\VerifyLangCookie::class,
    ]);
})
```

### Laravel 10 or older

Include middleware within the `web` group in `middlewareGroups` array (`app/Http/Kernel.php`):
```php
'web' => [
    \mputkowski\Localization\Middleware\VerifyLangCookie::class,
],
```

**You don't have to register service provider and alias, this package uses Package Auto-Discovery.**

## Configuration
Configuration is stored in `config/localization.php` file.

|Key|Type|Default|
|---|---|---|
|auto|bool|true|
|cookie_name|string|`lang`|
|default_locale|string|`en`|
|**Route**||
|enabled|bool|true|
|pattern|string|`/lang/{lang}`|

### Auto-detection
If `auto` is set to `true`, the app will automatically detect client's language. The lang directory will be compared with the client's `Accept-Language` header. If header doesn't match with the app's locales, language will be set to default.

Auto-detected language could be changed by accessing a special route designed for that, or by calling the `setLocale` method:

```php
use mputkowski\Localization\Facades\Localization;

Localization::setLocale('en');
```

### Route
This package also provides routes for quick language change (url: `/lang/{lang}`, example `/lang/en`).
