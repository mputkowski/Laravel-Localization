Powerful Localization for Laravel 5

## Installation
Add package to composer.json
```
composer require mputkowski/laravel-localization
```
Publish package's config file
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="mputkowski\Localization\ServiceProvider"
```
Include middleware within the `web` group in `middlewareGroups` array (`app/Http/Kernel.php`):
```php
'web' => [
    \mputkowski\Localization\Middleware\VerifyLangCookie::class,
],
```
**You don't have to register service provider and alias, this package uses Package Auto-Discovery.**

### Manual installation
```
composer require mputkowski/laravel-localization
```
In `config/app.php`, add the following to `providers` array:
```php
'providers' => [
    mputkowski\Localization\ServiceProvider::class,
],
```
And register alias in `aliases` array:
```php
'aliases' => [
    'Localization' => mputkowski\Localization\Facades\Localization::class,
],
```
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="mputkowski\Localization\ServiceProvider"
```
Include middleware within the `web` group in `middlewareGroups` array (`app/Http/Kernel.php`):
```php
'web' => [
    \mputkowski\Localization\Middleware\VerifyLangCookie::class,
],
```

## Configuration
Configuration is stored in `config/localization.php` file.

|Key|Type|Default|
|---|---|---|
|auto|bool|true|
|cookie_name|string|`lang`|
|default_locale|string|`en`|
|**Route**||
|enabled|bool|true|
|pattern|string|`/lang/{lang}`|

### Auto-detection
If `auto` is set to `true`, app will automatically detect client's language. Directories in `resources/lang` will be compared with client's `Accept-Language` header. If header doesn't match with app's locales, language will be set to default. 

### Route
This package also provides routes for quick language change (url: `/lang/{lang}`, example `/lang/en`).
